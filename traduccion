Connectivity / Network Issues

JMeter Slave saturated → cannot process requests → Master Timeout

Pipeline execution time does not match the test SLA

RMI Timeouts due to default configuration

Machine Capability Assessment

| Resource | Lab Machine Specs                    | General JMeter Recommendation                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| CPU      | Intel i5-8500T – 6 cores / 6 threads | ✔️ Sufficient for medium-scale load generation |
| RAM      | 7.6 GB                               | ✔️ Good for GUI Master or low-load Slave       |
| Disk     | NVMe 218 GB                          | ✔️ Very good, fast and large enough            |
| Network  | Standard 1 GbE                       | ✔️ Suitable for distributed testing            |
| OS       | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS                     | ✔️ Fully compatible                            |

JMeter Performance Estimates

| Test Type            | Virtual Users     | Requests/sec      |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Simple HTTP          | **1,500 – 3,000** | **200 – 800**     |
| HTTP with large JSON | **600 – 1,200**   | **80 – 300**      |
| WebSockets / gRPC    | **300 – 700**     | **<150**          |
| Selenium             | ❌ 5–20 browsers   | ❌ Not recommended |


Upgraded Slave (Memory Only)

| Resource | Upgraded Slave (RAM Only)            | General JMeter Recommendation                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU      | Intel i5-8500T – 6 cores / 6 threads | Sufficient for medium-scale distributed load generation |
| RAM      | **16 GB**                            | Good for higher thread counts and larger JVM heap       |
| Disk     | NVMe 218 GB                          | Fast and large enough                                   |
| Network  | Standard 1 GbE                       | Suitable for distributed testing                        |
| OS       | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS                     | Fully compatible                                        |


New “Super Machine” Slave

| Resource | New “Super Machine” Slave   | General JMeter Recommendation                          |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU      | 12 cores / 24 threads       | Ideal for high-scale tests and complex scripts      |
| RAM      | **32 GB**                   | Great for large heap sizes and thousands of threads |
| Disk     | NVMe 500 GB                 | Excellent speed and capacity                        |
| Network  | 1–10 GbE (10 GbE preferred) | Optimal for high-volume distributed testing         |
| OS       | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS            | Fully compatible                                    |


Implement performance configuration optimizations on the JMeter master and slave nodes.
Run the Azure pipeline directly from the JMeter master server .31 to minimize additional network traffic between the performance test and pipeline execution.



| Configuration                         | Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Master + Slave with increased RAM     | Leverages existing hardware, lower cost     | Still a small distributed environment        |
| Master + Super Slave                  | Excellent load capacity, future scalability | Higher cost                                  |
| Single Super Machine (no distributed) | Simplicity, zero Master–Slave latency       | Single point of failure; limited to one host |
